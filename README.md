* Enter new product (product details are listed below)
* Find product by name/brand
* Update/remove product
* See all leftovers on a separate page (leftovers means product which quantity is less than 5)

*Product details*:
* Name
* Brand
* Price
* Quantity

It should be two users - admin (can create, add, remove) and user with read-only access.

# Non-functional requirements
* All application layers should be covered with tests
* This system should be written using spring boot
* All data should be accessed using REST API.
* application should be compliant with 12factor apps approach (https://12factor.net)

yourself.
* Export search result as an xls file
* Application should run in docker container.
* Consider more complex security mechanism like JWT.
* provide virtual configs for 2 envs (staging and prod)
